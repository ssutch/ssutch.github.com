						technology stack for years to come. For Bread's infrastructure I chose a swarm 
						of microservices written in Go and hosted on GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine).
						For our frontend technolgy I managed the development of iOS and Android native
						apps, and created an in-house HTML5 platform which dramatically 
						improved our turn around time for high-iteration products like our exchange product.

					<ul>
						<li>Built out a HTML5 platform that allows for live app updates</li>
						<li>Stable and secure backend infrastructure with 9-second deploys to production</li>
