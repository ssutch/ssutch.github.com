    <h2>About</h2>
    <section class="intro">
        <p>
            Hi there! My name is Samuel, though most people call me Sam. I made this website
            to keep track of where I've been in my professional life, for my own sake, but I
            hope you find it useful as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            My story is not unlike many others in the technology field, one where a hobby became
            a life-long passion. For one reason or another, I have been creating software for over
            15 years. The industry took hold of me as a teenager, during long Montana winters with
            little else to do, and really cemented itself once I moved to Silicon Valley.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a very fortunate person indeed, my career has provided a lot of growth over the years.
            I've had the opportunity to work with some incredible companies, as well as create a
            few of my own. You could say I've had a lot of on-the-job training in both software
            engineering as well as business management.
        </p>
        <p>
            One persistent theme across all of the work I find enjoyable is solving
            hard problems with a great team. Most recently, I find myself taking on leadership roles,
            however I enjoy and resepect every aspect of the creation process.

                        In the over 5 years I have been at BRD we have seen incredible growth and expansion. From
                        relatively humble beginnings as a simple Bitcoin wallet for iOS, the BRD portfolio is now much

                        Making Friends' mission was to dramatically improve the quality and effectiveness
                        of autism care services. We started in 2013 with an iPad game focused on teaching
                        social skills to kids on the medium-high autistic spectrum. In 2014 we pivoted
                        into a patient management platform as we learned more about the space. In 2015 our
                        staff and product was acquired by Nightingale.

                        ancestor to Snapchat and Instagram Stories. It was a video capture
                        and consuption application that allowed you to capture short segments
                        that became part of an infite timeline you could jump into at any time.

                    of the business wanted to digitize the plan exchange (a way for contractors to bid on
                    projects that interest them) and I volunteered to help. This turned out to be a great
                    project and there are now several successful companies that offer this server as a SaaS
                    product.
